nuffsaid-mvc
============

An [Anax-MVC][1] based forum for asking questions and receiving answers.

Built to be similar to StackOverflow as per the [requirements][2] in the course I'm reading.

The current core implementation of nuffsaid is a swedish chat about gaming.


Setup
============

Download and unzip the content to get started.

Make sure you have write access to the data folder and the database in the folder.

Make sure you have write access to the webroot/nuffsaid-base folder and on the files
